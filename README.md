## My process

Create all the HTML code to get the structure setup to design the card. Then styled it using the CSS. Applying Flexbox to align everything - the card and items within the card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I have been able to apply Flexbox better this time from doing the previous assignment on the QR code and found it easier as I could apply my own knowledge.
